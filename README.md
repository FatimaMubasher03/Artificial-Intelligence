**Breadth-First Search (BFS)** is a graph traversal algorithm that explores nodes level by level, starting from a given node. It uses a queue to ensure that all nodes at a certain depth are visited before moving to the next level.

### Key Points:
- **Explores level by level**, visiting all neighbors before moving deeper.
- **Uses a queue** (FIFO) to track nodes to visit.
- **Finds shortest paths** in unweighted graphs.
- **Time complexity**: O(V + E), where V is vertices and E is edges. 

### Applications:
- Finding the shortest path.
- Exploring nodes within a specific range or depth.
